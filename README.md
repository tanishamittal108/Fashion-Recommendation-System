Fashion Recommendation System

A Machine Learning based Fashion Recommendation System that suggests similar clothing items using image feature extraction and similarity search. This project focuses purely on the ML pipeline without frontend/backend integration.

Features

📸 Image-based recommendations – find similar clothing items.

🧠 Deep learning feature extraction – uses pretrained CNN models (e.g., ResNet, VGG16).

📊 Content-based recommendation – computes similarity between items using embeddings.

⚡ Efficient nearest neighbor search – cosine similarity / k-NN on extracted features.

🧪 Experiment-ready notebooks – step-by-step Jupyter notebooks for training & testing.

Tech Stack

Python

NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning)

OpenCV, Pillow (Image Processing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Workflow

Dataset Preparation

Load fashion dataset (e.g., DeepFashion / Fashion-MNIST).

Preprocess images (resize, normalize).

Feature Extraction

Use pretrained CNN (VGG16, ResNet50, etc.) to extract embeddings.

Similarity Computation

Compute cosine similarity or Euclidean distance between embeddings.

Store embeddings in .pkl for quick lookup.

Recommendation

Given a query image, find Top-N similar images using nearest neighbors.

Evaluation

Qualitative evaluation (visually check similar items).

Quantitative metrics (if labels available, e.g., precision@k).

Future Work

🛍️ Integrate with frontend/backend for live demo.

🤖 Extend to hybrid recommendation (combine collaborative filtering).

🪄 Build outfit matching system (suggest shoes/bags for a dress).

⚡ Use FAISS / Annoy for fast similarity search on large datasets.
